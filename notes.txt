In the provided code, & > div is a CSS selector that targets direct child div elements within the Container component.

Specifically, the CSS rule margin-top: 20px is applied to those direct child div elements. This rule adds a top margin of 20px to each direct child div within the Container component.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the CSS rule means:

&: The ampersand (&) is a special character in styled-components that refers to the component itself. In this case, it represents the Container component.
>: The greater-than symbol (>) is a CSS combinator used to select direct child elements.
div: This refers to the div elements that are direct children of the Container component.
